- 👋 Hi, I’m Ansh Sharma, a passionate learner
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of things in life, the conscious intent has always been to learn something new every day and this has helped me to get skilled in a lot of things which include graphic designing, music composition, song writing, instruments especially harmonium and several percussions. I know several programming languages such as C, HTML, CSS, JS and a lil bit of React and Java
- 🌱 I’m currently learning some programming languages such as java and react alongside the indian classical music
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project based on my skills. it's even better if i get the chance to help somebody through my work and put on a big smile to someone's face
